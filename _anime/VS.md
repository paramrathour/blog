Far to the west...<br>
and across the sea..<br>
there's a place called Vinland<br>
warm and bountiful, it is a distant land..<br>
beyond the reach of slave-traders...<br>
and the flames of the war<br>
Let's go there together
<br><br>
A story that resonates with me on a personal level. Add to that an equally impactful Viking setting, character ideologies, and the epic soundtrack by Yutaka Yamada, its all there

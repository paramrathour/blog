Season 1 Part 1: Rudeus is without a doubt an abominable human, but are you willing to give him a chance to redeem himself?
<br><br>
Season 1 Part 2: Finally an ecchi anime which doesn't need its ecchi elements to stand up.
<br>
Perfect example of worldbuilding done right. The work oozes the passion put up by the staff. Also, a shoutout to Yuiko Ōhara.
<br><br>
Season 2 Part 1: An ecchi protagonist who needs all the ecchi elements to stand up ( ͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °).
<br>
This cour feels like a setup for the next half, just like the first cour of S1. But it had its moments, nevertheless.
<br>
Excited to know what happens next.

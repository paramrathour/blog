Season 1: This is amazing
<br><br>
OVA 2: 'No Regrets' is surprisingly good!
<br><br>
Season 2: glad I rewatched it, you will know you're reborn tonight.
<br><br>
Season 3 Part 1: Red Swan ðŸ’–
<br><br>
Season 3 Part 2: This is amazing, right?
<br><br>
Season 4 Part 1: Reinstated my love for AoT
<br><br>
Season 4 Part 2: Peak! Thaw is the best AoT episode yet and Gabi is incredible
<br>
Honourable Mention: Night of the End
<br><br>
Season 4 Part 3: From everything making sense to almost everything making sense, I can see why people do not like the later parts.
<br>
However, the reason I love AoT is its realistic portrayal of war and its diverse & intricate character cast.

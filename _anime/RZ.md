Season 1: Shocking, horrifying and always kept me at the edge of my seat.
<br>
Contains two of the most impactful moments I have ever experienced in anime, both involving our Best Girl Rem.
<br><br>
Movie 2: Frozen Bond is a must-watch backstory
<br><br>
Season 2 Part 1: Kinda getting used to the shock value
<br><br>
Season 2 Part 2: Okay, it hasn't lost its charm yet.

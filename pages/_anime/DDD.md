Under the beautifully animated visuals and the chaotic soundtrack, lies the same ~~generic~~ shy boy Ã— hyperactive girl trope. Though I did like how Momo isn't just your attractive female lead but she is also smart and intuitive during fights.\
The best part (just like _The Apothecary Diaries_), was again, the "side-stories", well that's what happens when you can't relate with anime teenagers anymore.

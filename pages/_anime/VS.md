Far to the west...\
and across the sea..\
there's a place called Vinland\
warm and bountiful, it is a distant land..\
beyond the reach of slave-traders...\
and the flames of the war\
Let's go there together\
\
A story that resonates with me on a personal level.\
Add to that an equally impactful Viking setting, character ideologies, and the epic soundtrack by Yutaka Yamada, its all there

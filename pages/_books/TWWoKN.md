Oh, I have great memories with this one.\
It was my first "recreational" math book, back when I had no clue about internet education. It was my introduction to the holy Kaprekar's constant, plus I learnt about so many cool numbers and manipulations: from Harshad numbers, monkey numbers to palindromes and magic squares.

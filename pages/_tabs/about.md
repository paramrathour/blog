Hello! I am Wrath.

I am a Geek by Numbers, an Otaku by Nature and a Philosopher at Heart. More details about me are [here]({{ site.url }}/about-me).

This website serves as a platform for me to share the thoughts I've held onto for quite some time.
Down the road, I might toss in some math/CS tutorials. Let's see how things unfold!

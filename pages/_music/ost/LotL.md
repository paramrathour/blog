The <a href="https://youtu.be/_4QFF0gZrVo">insane sound direction</a> in this anime made me realise how music is much more than just complexity. And yes, Erhu has quickly become one of my favourite instrument.

Fujisawa has also achieved success with the OST of <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/39535">Mushoku Tensei</a>, <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/35839">A Place Further Than The Universe</a>, <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/35503">Revue Starlight</a> and more.

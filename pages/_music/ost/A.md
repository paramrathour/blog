Kanno is one of the most beloved music composers. Her influential works include [Terror in Resonance]({{ site.url_prefixes.myanimelist.anime }}/23283), [Cowboy Bebop]({{ site.url_prefixes.myanimelist.anime }}/1), [Wolf's Rain]({{ site.url_prefixes.myanimelist.anime }}/202), [Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex]({{ site.url_prefixes.myanimelist.anime }}/467), [Kids on the Slope]({{ site.url_prefixes.myanimelist.anime }}/12531) and many more. _Arjuna_, though underrated, has been equally impactful.

Kanno is one of the most beloved music composers. Her influential works include [Terror in Resonance]({{ site.url_prefixes.myanimelist.anime }}/23283), [Cowboy Bebop]({{ site.url_prefixes.myanimelist.anime }}/1), [Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex]({{ site.url_prefixes.myanimelist.anime }}/467) and many more. _Arjuna_, though underrated, is equally impactful.

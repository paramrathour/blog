Kanno is one of the most beloved music composers. Her influential works include <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/23283">Terror in Resonance</a>, <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/1">Cowboy Bebop</a>, <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/467">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a> and many more. <i>Arjuna</i>, though underrated, is equally impactful.

Well I am cheating a bit here, as Re:ZERO's season 3 hasn't aired yet. But I am sure its OST will make it here.

While my favourite track composed by Kenichiro Suehiro is no doubt the <a href="https://youtu.be/CI3CzBKkQeE">Requiem of Silence</a>, overall my favourite work of his is <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/35838">Girls' Last Tour</a> with its <a href="https://youtu.be/qQEtaBCQlvU">hauntingly</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/hynCI3AsbqM">beautiful</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/HMAfMwLVLdU">vocal</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/67STFqbZxTM">performances</a>.
His other prominent works include <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/48316">The Eminence in Shadow</a>, <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/36028">Golden Kamuy</a>.

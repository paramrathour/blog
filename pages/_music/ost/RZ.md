Well, I am cheating a bit here, as Re:ZERO's season 3 hasn't aired yet. But I am sure its OST will make it here.\
While my favourite track composed by Kenichiro Suehiro is undoubtedly the [Requiem of Silence]({{ site.url_prefixes.youtube.video }}/CI3CzBKkQeE); overall, my favourite work of his is [Girls' Last Tour]({{ site.url_prefixes.myanimelist.anime }}/35838), with its [hauntingly]({{ site.url_prefixes.youtube.video }}/qQEtaBCQlvU) [beautiful]({{ site.url_prefixes.youtube.video }}/hynCI3AsbqM) [vocal]({{ site.url_prefixes.youtube.video }}/HMAfMwLVLdU) [performances]({{ site.url_prefixes.youtube.video }}/67STFqbZxTM).
His other prominent works include [The Eminence in Shadow]({{ site.url_prefixes.myanimelist.anime }}/48316) and [Golden Kamuy]({{ site.url_prefixes.myanimelist.anime }}/36028).

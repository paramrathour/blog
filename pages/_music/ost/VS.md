Yutaka Yamada is in my humble opinion, a highly underrated composer. His tracks often tell a story, whether they are his <a href="https://youtu.be/CHgewxzACJA">piano</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/r0jKNgewjbE">melodies</a>, or the <a href="https://youtu.be/XmYAU2R-C9E">choir song</a> that inspired the name of this blog :).

While the anime, <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/22319">Tokyo Ghoul</a> and <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/40052">Great Pretender</a> didn't receive a great amount of positive attention for it stories, its music still stood out.

Yutaka Yamada is in my humble opinion, a highly underrated composer. His tracks often tell a story, whether they are his [piano]({{ site.url_prefixes.youtube.video }}/CHgewxzACJA) [melodies]({{ site.url_prefixes.youtube.video }}/r0jKNgewjbE) or the [choir song]({{ site.url_prefixes.youtube.video }}/XmYAU2R-C9E) that inspired the name of this blog :).\
While the anime [Tokyo Ghoul]({{ site.url_prefixes.myanimelist.anime }}/22319), [Great Pretender]({{ site.url_prefixes.myanimelist.anime }}/40052) and [Viral Hit]({{ site.url_prefixes.myanimelist.anime }}/58080) didn't receive much positive attention for its stories, their music still stood out.

H×H has a perfect soundtrack. From its [light-hearted]({{ site.url_prefixes.youtube.video }}/hllGJbb0Knw) themes to [shιt just got real]({{ site.url_prefixes.youtube.video }}/r0zB4_dM5K8) tracks, there is a theme for everything. And [Understanding]({{ site.url_prefixes.youtube.video }}/kdEe8RkKqwU) is the most beautiful piece ever to exist.
The composer also co-composed for [Death Note]({{ site.url_prefixes.myanimelist.anime }}/1535), taking care of the [orchestral]({{ site.url_prefixes.youtube.video }}/tAMhUyLwD4k) side.

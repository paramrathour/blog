FMAB might be a better anime overall but beautiful music of FMA by Michiru Oshima is something else. [The Tatami Galaxy]({{ site.url_prefixes.myanimelist.anime }}/7785), [Bloom Into You]({{ site.url_prefixes.myanimelist.anime }}/37786), [Little Witch Academia]({{ site.url_prefixes.myanimelist.anime }}/33489) are some of her other works.

My first love for anime music. It was with this anime I realised that background music can be _cinematic_. She has made a name for herself by working on [Madoka Magica]({{ site.url_prefixes.myanimelist.anime }}/9756), [Sword Art Online]({{ site.url_prefixes.myanimelist.anime }}/11757), [Demon Slayer]({{ site.url_prefixes.myanimelist.anime }}/38000) and the [Fate]({{ site.url_prefixes.myanimelist.anime }}/10087) franchises, utilising her [made-up language]({{ site.url_prefixes.youtube.video }}/bzlHPlq8hIs) to create lyrics.

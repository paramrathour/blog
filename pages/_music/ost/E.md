My first love for anime music. It was with this anime I realised that background music can be <i>cinematic</i>. She has made a name for herself by working on <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/9756">Madoka Magica</a>, <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/11757">Sword Art Online</a>, <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/38000">Demon Slayer</a> and the <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/10087">Fate</a> franchise utilising her own <a href="https://youtu.be/bzlHPlq8hIs">made-up language</a> to create lyrics.

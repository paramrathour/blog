Speaking of <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/54492">The Apothecary Diaries</a>, alright, I won't try another segue :D.
<br>
Kevin Penkin introduces himself as <i>an Aussie bloke who occasionally produces beeps and boops</i>; even his song lyrics are <a href="https://youtu.be/mnRoh0lGxwM">gibberish</a> sometimes. But that's how I realised the <a href="https://youtu.be/oCrVXdkBCeg">emotion</a> of music is not in the lyrics but in that <i>noise</i>.
<br>
His other liked works include <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/35790">The Rising of the Shield Hero</a>, <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/40221">Tower of God</a> and the currently airing <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/51122">Spice and Wolf</a> readaptation.

Speaking of [The Apothecary Diaries]({{ site.url_prefixes.myanimelist.anime }}/54492), alright, I won't try another segue :D.\
Kevin Penkin introduces himself as _an Aussie bloke who occasionally produces beeps and boops_; even his song lyrics are [gibberish]({{ site.url_prefixes.youtube.video }}/mnRoh0lGxwM) sometimes. But that's how I realised the [emotion]({{ site.url_prefixes.youtube.video }}/oCrVXdkBCeg) of music is not in the lyrics but in that _noise_.\
His other liked works include [The Rising of the Shield Hero]({{ site.url_prefixes.myanimelist.anime }}/35790), [Tower of God]({{ site.url_prefixes.myanimelist.anime }}/40221),  [Spice and Wolf]({{ site.url_prefixes.myanimelist.anime }}/51122) readaptation and the upcoming anime [BÃ¢an: The Boundary of Adulthood]({{ site.url_prefixes.myanimelist.anime }}/61984).

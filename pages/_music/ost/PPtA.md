I can describe Ushio's works in one word -- <a href="https://youtu.be/w_I1MWCTkyQ">MADNESS</a>. What sets him apart is his unique way of incorporating non-standard musical instruments such as ping-pong balls, toys, and household items in the composition. His music for <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/35120">Devilman: Crybaby</a>, <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/28851">A Silent Voice</a> and the recent <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/44511">Chainsaw Man</a> anime has had a significant influence on the industry.

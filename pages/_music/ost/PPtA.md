I can describe Ushio's works in one word -- [MADNESS]({{ site.url_prefixes.youtube.video }}/w_I1MWCTkyQ). His unique way of incorporating non-standard musical instruments, such as ping-pong balls, toys, and household items in the composition sets him apart. His music for [Devilman: Crybaby]({{ site.url_prefixes.myanimelist.anime }}/35120), [A Silent Voice]({{ site.url_prefixes.myanimelist.anime }}/28851) and the recent [Chainsaw Man]({{ site.url_prefixes.myanimelist.anime }}/44511) anime has significantly influenced the industry.

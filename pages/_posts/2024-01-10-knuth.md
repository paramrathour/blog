> I put this post together as a fun little activity for the CS310 (Automata Theory) course at IIT Bombay.
At first, I was hesitant to write about Don Knuth because there were already so many write-ups, but I couldn't resist after finding out it was his birthday that day.\
I have kept this post intentionally short to encourage you to dive deeper into whichever aspects of his life you find interesting

## Impacts
[Knuth]({{ page.url_knuth }})[^homepage] (pronounced as _Ka-NOOTH_) is best known for his magnum opus [The Art of Computer Programming]({{ page.url_knuth }}/taocp.html) (TAoCP) volumes (work in progress) covering a wide range of topics from sorting to context-free languages.

_The Art of Computer Programming Volumes_
These books are not for everyone; in fact, Knuth himself has mentioned that he writes them specifically for people who think like him (with a peculiar kind of brain). To get an idea of Knuth's thought-process, read the following story.
> In eighth grade, he entered a contest to find the number of words that the letters in "Ziegler's Giant Bar" could be rearranged to create; the judges had identified 2,500 such words. With time gained away from school due to a fake stomachache Knuth used an unabridged dictionary and determined whether each dictionary entry could be formed using the letters in the phrase. Using this algorithm, he identified over 4,500 words, winning the contest.\

While working on these volumes, he was disappointed with the quality of typesetting, which led him to develop [TeX]({% post_url 2023-12-17-latex-tips %}) and the beloved Computer Modern fonts, which are now a standard in academia.

_Knuth's other works_
While developing TeX, he created the [Literate Programming]({{ site.url_prefixes.wikipedia }}/Literate_programming) paradigm, which again impacted millions of programmers.
Who would've thought his _little_ detours would keep making such a huge impact?
 
While I can mention some of his other popular works such as [Surreal Numbers]({{ page.url_knuth }}/sn.html), a book  he finished in just a week, or [Things a Computer Scientist Rarely Talks About]({{ page.url_knuth }}/things.html), which deals with faith and science,  I would instead like to highlight his often overlooked gem on [Concrete Mathematics]({{ page.url_knuth }}/gkp.html), which is an amalgamation of CONtinuous and disCRETE mathematics which arose from TAoCP. This book was a very fun read while maintaining rigour at the same time.
 
Happy birthday!

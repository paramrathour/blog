> I put this post together as a fun little activity for the CS310 (Automata Theory) course at IIT Bombay.
At first, I was hesitant to write about Don Knuth because there were already so many write-ups, but I couldn't resist after finding out it was his birthday that day.\
I have kept this post intentionally short to encourage you to dive deeper into whichever aspects of his life you find interesting. Also, don't forget to check out [bloopers](#bloopers).

## Introduction
My introduction to Knuth's work goes way further back than I initially realised. It was through the [Numberphile]({{ site.url_prefixes.youtube.home }}/@numberphile) video about Graham's Number, which explained [Knuth's arrow notation]({{ site.url_prefixes.wikipedia }}/Knuth%27s_up-arrow_notation)[^grahamsnumber], a way to describe ridiculously fast growing _hyperoperations_. Back then, I had no idea who Knuth was, so when I came across Graham's Number again later in my life, it felt amazing, like all the dots just connected at once.

## Impacts
[Knuth]({{ page.url_knuth }})[^homepage] (pronounced as _Ka-NOOTH_) is best known for his magnum opus [The Art of Computer Programming]({{ page.url_knuth }}/taocp.html) (TAoCP) volumes (work in progress) covering a wide range of topics from sorting to context-free languages.

_The Art of Computer Programming Volumes (cover pages by [informIT](https://www.informit.com/search/index.aspx?query=donald+knuth))_
These books are not for everyone; in fact, Knuth himself has mentioned that he writes them specifically for people who think like him (people with a peculiar kind of brain). To get an idea of Knuth's thought-process, read the following excerpt.
> In eighth grade, he entered a contest to find the number of words that the letters in "Ziegler's Giant Bar" could be rearranged to create; the judges had identified 2,500 such words. With time gained away from school due to a fake stomachache, Knuth used an unabridged dictionary and determined whether each dictionary entry could be formed using the letters in the phrase. Using this algorithm, he identified over 4,500 words, winning the contest.\

This story in particular really resonated with me, as I did something similar back in primary school.
I remember scouring through a dictionary to find like 200 words from a phrase, though I can't recall that phrase.

While working on the TAoCP volumes, he was disappointed with the quality of typesetting, which led him to develop [TeX]({% post_url 2023-12-17-latex-tips %}) and the beloved Computer Modern fonts, which revolutionised the landscape of digital typography and have now become a standard in academia.

_Knuth's other works (cover pages by [informIT](https://www.informit.com/search/index.aspx?query=donald+knuth))_
While developing TeX, he created the [Literate Programming]({{ site.url_prefixes.wikipedia }}/Literate_programming) paradigm, which again impacted millions of programmers.
Who would've thought his _little_ detours would keep making such a huge impact?
 
While I can mention some of his other popular works such as [Surreal Numbers]({{ page.url_knuth }}/sn.html), a conversational book about discovering numbers that he finished in just a week, or [Things a Computer Scientist Rarely Talks About]({{ page.url_knuth }}/things.html), which deals with faith and science, I would instead like to highlight his often overlooked gem on [Concrete Mathematics]({{ page.url_knuth }}/gkp.html), which is an amalgamation of CONtinuous and disCRETE mathematics which arose from TAoCP. The "mathematical graffiti" on its margins, which were submitted by the authors and students of Stanford made this book a very fun read.
> Knuth used to reward people with checks for spotting errors in his books[^rewardchecks], which eventually led to its own [financial fiasco]({{ page.url_knuth }}/news08.html). Anyway, when _Concrete Mathematics_ was released, the errors in the graffiti started being reported faster than those in the text, showing just how much people enjoyed reading them.

_Knuth's Selected Papers (cover pages by [The University of Chicago Press](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/author/K/D/au5294038.html))_
Lastly, his _Selected Papers_ series is an anthology of essays surveying his papers across various domains in Computer Science, from _Computer Languages_ and _Algorithms_ to _Discrete Mathematics_ and some _Fun & Games_.

And, this concludes the post, I hope you enjoy reading the recommended books and videos. Happy birthday Knuth!

Hello World! This is my space where I talk about the meta aspects of the blog, like its lore, underlying motivations and the direction it is intended to take.

## The Journey Begins
![](/06-10-30.jpg)
I first got the idea to make my own blog wayback in 2020 as a way to dump my ramblings and IITB experiences. One of the primary motivating factors was to publish topics that frequently arose in my conversations with others. I had even put up a [coming soon](https://web.archive.org/web/20201012070646/https://paramrathour.github.io/Blog) page, with the plan to use the [random stuff]({{ site.url }}/random-stuff) page until I could organize my thoughts. But well, it (almost) never happened. I was too caught up with courses, assignments, watching anime or making CS101 [problem sets]({{ site.url }}/CS-101/Problems.pdf) ~~that hardly anybody solved~~ to find time for it. As a result, my wishlist of blog ideas kept piling up. It didn't help that I was never really passionate about writing, having never maintained any sort of diary/journal nor tried my hands at reviews/essay writing. My only comfort was in writing proofs xD.

The first big jump came in 2022, while I was TAing for the then CS101 batch. I got inspired by the coding tips provided by [Andrews](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrews-varghese-a62680176) to the students and thought to add my own two cents from my multiple TAship experiences. The original write-up was super rough; it was more like a [glorified list](https://web.archive.org/web/20250816224658/https://paramrathour.github.io/cs101/tips), which looking back feels so unpolished :D

## The Light of Dawn
![](/14-20-40.jpg)
Fast forward to December 2023, I was in my fifth year, having recently completed the 9<sup>th</sup> semester consisting of DDP-Stage I (Dual Degree Project) and two heavy courses. You would think I had all the time to relax and have fun in this winter vacation, but I was stuck in a full-on _quarter-life crisis_, a time filled with frustration and existential insecurities. I was terribly bored; neither anime/TV shows nor random youtube videos seemed enjoyable. And so, after putting it off for years, I finally resolved to _shift from consuming others' content to creating my own_, and thus began my journey into blogging.

## Out of the Cradle
![](/18-15-40.jpg)
The first, and the toughest task was to find a good blogging template. Being someone with very little interest in modern web development, I needed a template that could already do most things right. And I was unable to find one even after hours of searching for [free jekyll themes](https://jekyll-themes.com/free). I loved the UI and workflow of [Wermos's blog](https://wermos.github.io/blog/), which we both had already discussed upon. In fact, its content was another one of my motivating factors, and it was becoming very tempting to use a template similar to his. But then, with a stroke of luck, I stumbled on a site[^howifoundchirpy] listing some of the best Jekyll blogging themes and that's where I found [Chirpy](https://chirpy.cotes.page/), the theme I ultimately ended up going with!

I quickly picked the name "Somewhere Not Here", which is actually the title of the first episode of _Vinland Saga_ and also one of my favourite [musical]({{ site.url_prefixes.youtube.video }}/l3jmDt_qYUE) [piece]({{ site.url_prefixes.youtube.video }}/XmYAU2R-C9E).

> I have always placed emphasis on layered names, which often have double (or even triple) meanings.\
For example, _Somewhere Not Here_ has a beautiful interpretation that will retain its relevance even if (hypothetically of course) I were to lose interest in Vinland Saga.

## End of the Prologue
![](/24-22-00.jpg)
After making few aesthetic changes to the template, I was all set and  kicked things off with the [timelines](/blog/tags/timeline). They were the easiest to make, all I needed to do was to gather my thoughts on certain things and  lay them out visually. It also helped me become familiar with the Jekyll's _collections_ feature, which allowed for convenient and [automatic]({{ site.url_prefixes.github.param }}/blog/blob/main/pages/_posts/2023-12-14-manga-timeline.md#timeline) updates to the timeline.
Then I started by rewriting my [CS101 tips]({% post_url 2022-04-08-cs101-tips %}), expanding it to a whole new level, and honestly felt pretty proud with the end result :D.

> Hurray! I finally had something to show-off.

## Slave
![](/25-17-00.jpg)

Well, get ready for a time skip, if you thought I would be churning out blog posts now that I had everything setup, then oh boy, were you wrong. By now, I had became a ...

... slave to originality
: There were so many ideas that I ditched because someone else had already done an amazing job on it, and I felt like I can barely improve upon it. Examples include the [self-help](https://shreyasnadkarni.medium.com/)ish stuff and the [philosophical deep dives](https://ksr.onl/blog/) made by my friends and also, the surprisingly intuitive and exciting math [articles](https://www.science4all.org/articles/) and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkahZjV5wKe-Z1RP3ZiYwe8JSAolmqF9M)/[playlists](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsdeQ7TnWVm_EQG1rmb34ZBYe5ohrkL3t) available on the internet.\
Even for posts that looked generic, I gave them a unique twist to set them apart from the rest.

... slave to perfection
: So many of my ideas just rot in the draft-stage as it requires a truckload of time and effort to polish them into blogs comparable to the quality with the rest of the site. Even after publishing them, I only popularise them after some time has elapsed. This allows me to share it with a smaller set of people and get feedback.\
Though, the biggest bottleneck is undoubtedly generating graphics; my obsession with creating perfectly vectorised (or otherwise lossless) images that are compatible with both [light and dark modes]({% post_url 2023-12-17-latex-tips %}/#code-highlighting-using-minted) leads to unimaginable levels of time waste. Such as the next image, which was improvised by our artist [aishik](https://nathaishik.github.io/). Check out his [art](https://www.instagram.com/nathaishik/)!

## Oath

![](/33-18-30-dark.jpg){: .dark}

Slowly but steadily, I got going with a quick and dirty trick of recycling my own content from other [courses]({% post_url 2024-01-10-knuth %})/[quizzes]({% post_url 2024-05-27-anime-soundtracks %})/[reviews]({% post_url 2024-06-09-cse-minor %})/[tips]({% post_url 2023-12-17-latex-tips %}). But even then, something felt off; I thought it lacked a personal touch, stuff that matters to me even if it doesn't really mean anything to anyone else (like this post ;). And with that realisation, I started working on ambitious projects such as [Hunter × Hunter]({% post_url 2024-07-16-hunter-hunter-little-things %}) and [Philosophy in Anime]({% post_url 2024-08-12-philosophy-in-anime %}).

> Even though those posts brought in a ton of traffic to the site, I just really enjoyed going back and rereading them myself; finding mistakes and refining them. That's when I realised, for me to feel truly satisfied, I need to design blogs that I would enjoy reading as an audience myself.

## Two Paths
![](/47-17-50.jpg)
So yeah, it became pretty clear that I will pursue the path of pure enjoyment, maybe with a faint hope that others can find enjoyment in the same things I do.

This is a complete departure to the often-advised route for aspiring content creators, which is about chasing trends, appeasing the almighty algorithm, and constantly grinding to stay relevant until the _algorithm becomes the content itself.[^algorithm]_
Well, most content creators have another problem to worry about, revenue! But that's not an issue here, as I strive to keep this blog always accessible, leaving it up to you to decide if it's worth your time :)

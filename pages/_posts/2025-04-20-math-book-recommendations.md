## Introduction
> Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show. The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than Man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as in poetry.\
--- Bertrand Russell

As said by Russell, mathematics possesses this beauty and creativity, and that has made it my favourite hobby. While there are many ways to learn math, particularly through formalism and abstraction, both of which are essential for any serious mathematical endeavours, I find a special, almost unexplainable comfort in reading pop-maths books and their fascinating stories. And, when those books are done right, they are perfect for getting curious people into math, especially the ones who want to dive in but don't know where to start or feel intimidated.

> The purpose of this blog is twofold: first, to serve as a curated wishlist of such resources, in the hope that it might inspire others to revisit mathematics. And second, you may have noticed the absence of explicit math blogs here, despite having math-y references scattered throughout my other non-mathematical posts. This is intentional, as there are already so many amazing resources out there, I didn't feel the need to just repeat what's already been done.

## Legendary Books
![](/math-books-legendary.jpg)
#### Must-Reads
A Mathematician's Apology (G. H. Hardy)
: A short essay where Hardy (mentor of Srinivasa Ramanujan) discusses the beauty and usefulness of pure mathematics.\
I wanted to start with this recommendation because the books mentioned may not directly help with exams or jobs, but they are meant more to explore the beauty of mathematics. I hope this inspires an appreciation for math, and I apologize if it's not what you were looking for.

Oliver Byrne's Elements of Euclid
: A beautiful work of art, where Byrne reimagined the first six books of _The Elements of Euclid_, replacing letters with vividly coloured diagrams and symbols. [[Website](https://www.c82.net/euclid/)/[PDF](https://github.com/jemmybutton/byrne-euclid/)]

Proofs from THE BOOK (Martin Aigner, Günter M. Ziegler)
: The famous math nomad, Paul Erdős, once said that you need not believe in God but, as a mathematician, you should believe in the existence of _THE BOOK_, which contains the most elegant and perfect proofs of all mathematical theorems. Is it this _THE BOOK_?

Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid (Douglas R. Hofstadter)
: Gödel, a mathematician; Escher, a graphic artist; and Bach, a music composer. What is the connection here? Dive in and find out!

#### Treatises
Principia Mathematica (Alfred North Whitehead, Bertrand Russell)
: This three-volume series is arguably the most important work in the history of mathematics and philosophy. And it also contains the _infamous_ 360 page proof of $$1+1=2$$.

Contributions to the Founding of the Theory of Transfinite Numbers (Georg Cantor)
: Contains important developments related to transfinite numbers, which are nothing but infinite numbers

The Mathematical Analysis of Logic (George Boole)
: The introduction of Calculus of Deductive Reasoning, aka Boolean Algebra

A Treatise on Probability (John Maynard Keynes)
: A "logical-relationist" approach to the theory of uncertainty, which has started to gain more traction due to advancements in _artificial intelligence_

The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe (Roger Penrose)
: The most ambitious work of science, providing a comprehensive account of the Standard Model of particle physics while also developing the mathematical theory required from scratch

#### Handbooks
A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics (George Shoobridge Carr)

The World of Mathematics (James R. Newman)
: The monumental four-volume set which includes a general survey of mathematics, historical and biographical information on prominent mathematicians throughout history

The Princeton Companion to Mathematics (Timothy Gowers, June Barrow-Green, Imre Leader)
: A one-of-a-kind reference for anyone with a serious interest in mathematics, covering popular mathematicians, concepts, theorems and most importantly expository introductions to many branches of mathematics.

## Fiction
![](/math-books-fiction.jpg)\
My taste in fictional math books is the same as A.A.: _only the very best, with just the right amount of math_

Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions (Edwin A. Abbott)
: A pioneering work of mathematical fiction, exploring the concept of dimensions through the eyes of our protagonist, Square, who is a Flatlander living in a 2-D world, Flatland

Lost in the Math Museum: A Survival Story (Colin Adams)
: The imaginative journey of a 16-year-old girl trying to escape death in a mathematics museum, leading her through a series of mathematical theorems, paradoxes, and curiosities.

## Miniatures
Miniatures are my favourite way to enjoy mathematics, they are a collection of short but entertaining tidbits from all across a particular field, which can be consumed at one's convenience.
With the exception of the first two fictional works and the last section, the majority of the forthcoming books fall under this category.
### For Newbies
![](/math-books-miniatures-beginners.jpg)

## Historical
There are tons of ways to dive into history of math, I think the best way to go with it is through engaging stories and not the dry, chronological reading. So, let us start with interesting collections of such stories.
![](/math-books-topics-history.jpg)

#### Biographical
The Man Who Loved Only Numbers: The Story of Paul Erdös and the Search for Mathematical Truth (Paul Hoffman)
: Remember Erdős? our nomad from [first section](#legendary-books) he wandered around the world in 83 years with two suitcases and collaborated with over 500 researchers. Such prolific output led to the creation of the Erdős number: a measure of the "collaborative distance" between a mathematician and Erdős, based on co-authored papers.

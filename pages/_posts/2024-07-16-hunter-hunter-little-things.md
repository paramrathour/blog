## Introduction 
[Hunter × Hunter](https://myanimelist.net/anime/11061/) or shortly H×H, is easily my favourite anime ever. The list of things I love about it is infinite, from its childish beginnings to its subversive endings to its story arcs; from its consistent animation to its <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" data-bs-html="true" data-bs-trigger="hover focus" title = "{{ hxh_ost.content | strip_html }}">[perfect music]({% post_url 2024-05-27-anime-soundtracks %}#HxH)</span>; from its interesting characters to its expressive power system, and beyond.

The purpose of this post, however, is to elaborate upon an underrated aspect of storytelling mentioned in <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" data-bs-html="true" data-bs-trigger="hover focus" title = "{{ hxh_anime.content }}">[my HxH thoughts]({% post_url 2023-12-14-anime-timeline %}#HxH)</span>. And that is the recurring attention to detail put in by its author, Togashi-sensei. 

Ideas are built up from seemingly mundane moments but are then reused at important moments on a much larger scale. This approach of consistent world-building avoids an over-reliance on shock factors, making the story feel more natural. It also rewards attentive viewers with not only a better understanding of the ongoing moments but also the satisfaction of grasping the context of previous moments. While this anime is filled with information, there are still secondary details that it expects the audience to fill up by connecting the dots.

It also helps that such ideas are not lost and in fact, many such ideas are consistently utilised to make developments. Such consistent use of ideas is what I will highlight in this post.

> From now onwards, this post will dive into spoiler territory. So, come back after watching 148 episodes of this anime. Just kidding :p, feel free to do what you want.

So, let's start with my favourite example before delving into specifics
![](/048-12.jpg)
_Episode [48](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_48_(2011))_
<!-- | ![](/048-11-11.jpg) _Episode [48](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_48_(2011))_ | ![](/048-12-22.jpg) _Episode [48](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_48_(2011))_ | -->
[Gon](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Gon_Freecss) and [Killua](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Killua_Zoldyck) stumble upon this "worthless" wooden statue in search of rare items to earn money. [Zepile](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Zepile) an appraiser, helps them to avoid getting scammed and teaches them about a counterfeiting technique called _ostomy_ which is creating an opening from an area inside the body to the outside. Now, when the duo was stuck in a guarded room, look what the boys did :)

## Visuals
### Silhouettes
![](/001-009-023-029-084.png)
_Episodes [1](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_1_(2011)), [9](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_9_(2011)), [23](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_23_(2011)), [29](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_29_(2011)), [84](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_84_(2011))_
A common theme before introducing a cast of characters is to share their silhouettes. From the shot of Hunters, the [Zoldycks](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Zoldyck_Family) and the [Heavens Arena](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena) contestants to the shot of the [Troupe](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Phantom_Troupe), and the [Royal Guards](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Royal_Guards).

Not only this introduces us to these characters way before they actually appear (such as Kite, Morel or Knuckle) but they also give subtle cues for the attentive observer such as
- [Hisoka](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Hisoka_Morow) at the right end of Troupe's picture adds more context to his presence in the Hunter exam and his final fight with [Kurapika](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Kurapika).
- Killua holding hands with someone signifying a close relationship with the later introduced [Alluka](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Alluka_Zoldyck).

![](/084-14-30.jpg)
_Episode [84](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_84_(2011))_
A silhouette of the King displaying his immense power before he is even born.
#### Smoke
![](/043-19-084-09.jpg)
_Episode [43](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_43_(2011)), [84](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_84_(2011))_
Both [Uvogin](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Uvogin) and [Kite](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Kite) appear out of the smoke totally unharmed, which crushes the enemy's will.
#### Mysterious × People
![](/021-17-043-16.jpg)
_Episodes [21](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_21_(2011)), [43](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_43_(2011))_
The shots of [Ging](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Ging_Freecss)'s flashback and [Ten Dons](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Ten_Dons) are both visually striking.
### Shadows
![](/002-13-034-18.jpg)
_Episodes [2](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_2_(2011)), [34](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_34_(2011))_
We see similar imagery when our trio and Hisoka leave the location and proceed to the next stage.
### Camera × Roll
![](/031-02-043-16-082-11.jpg)
_Episodes [31](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_31_(2011)), [43](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_43_(2011)), [82](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_82_(2011))_
Whether it is Gon's usual exercise or Uvogin's massacre or Killua's brutal kill, we see the camera roll with an uncomfortable view.
## Omnipresent × Nen
[Nen](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Nen) is the De facto power system of H×H. And arguably the best an anime has offered yet.
Though it is officially introduced to the protagonists in [episode 28](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_28_(2011)), Nen was always present in the series, even before this introduction. Of course this makes sense, after all Nen wasn't invented for the protagonists.
> I won't be delving into explaining the specifics of Nen, nor is it required for this blog, but if you are interested, refer to the [wiki](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Nen).
{: .prompt-info}

So, here are some instances of early Nen.
### Intentional × Usage
Cases with intentional usage of Nen by people
#### Hisoka
♦ Hisoka ♣ Morow ♥ the ♠ magician ★
![](/003-004-005-010.jpg)
_Episodes [3](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_3_(2011)), [4](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_4_(2011)), [5](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_5_(2011)), [10](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_10_(2011))_
We see his <i>magic</i> in action, right from his first appearance. Clearly, his cards contain Nen, and [Satotz](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Satotz) was quite skilled in catching them. Also, Hisoka was able to catch [Togari](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Togari)'s dual blades using the then-unexplained _Bungee Gum_.
> Did you know Bungee Gum has the properties of both rubber and gum?
{: .prompt-info}

#### Bloodlust
![](/007-020-027-028.jpg)
_Episodes [7](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_7_(2011)), [20](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_20_(2011)), [27](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_27_(2011)), [28](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_28_(2011))_
After stage 2 of the exam, Satotz and [Menchi](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Menchi) notices Hisoka's bloodlust and called it an outburst of negative **aura** giving us direct term to refer to for future displays of bloodlust. The animation team also made it easy to recognise such moments by using a unique visual style. This development culminates into [Neferpitou](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Neferpitou)'s vicious aura.
![](/086-20-56.jpg)
_Episode [86](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_86_(2011))_
#### [Zebro](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Zebro)
![](/022-11-30.jpg)
_Episode [22](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_22_(2011))_
Even the Zoldyck family's janitor was aware of Nen, as can be seen from the aura around him and a suspiciously similar procedure as below.

As it happens, Master [Wing](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Wing) did similar routines to confirm the above cases as valid Nen uses.
![](/028-04-028-09-028-21.jpg)
_Episode [28](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_28_(2011))_
### Unintentional × Usage
Cases of unintentional usage of Nen by people
#### Gon
![](/015-06-25.jpg)
_Episode [15](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_15_(2011))_
Gon, with his sharp senses, had naturally learned to identify both moments with no presence of life and moments with intense presence of bloodlust. We learned this information while he was observing [Pokkle](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Pokkle) and Hisoka, respectively. While spending his childhood in wildlife, he had already learned the technique to silence his presence called [Zetsu](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Nen#Zetsu), one of the four major Nen principles.
> As a bonus, consider the below image where both Nen users are using some vision enhancement ability. The aura around [Netero](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Isaac_Netero)'s fingers (right image) is clearly visible.
![](/015-21-086-16.jpg)
_Episodes [15](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_15_(2011)), [86](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_86_(2011))_
Gon was able to locate the subjects like Hisoka in the left situation. It could be Gon's senses again which shows that there are people born with natural abilities as well, _Nen isn't everything_.
{: .prompt-tip}

#### Kurapika
![](/010-02-036-04.jpg)
_Episodes [10](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_10_(2011)), [36](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_36_(2011))_
After his fight with [Majtani](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Majtani), Kurapika described that even when he sees a real spider, his personality changes and he enters into a frenzy. This information, coupled with Hisoka's  personality-based Nen test, reveals that Kurapika's Nen type changes _when his eyes turn red_. In fact, the types that fit Kurapika the most are Conjurer (high-strung) and Specialist (individualistic).
![](/047-19-30.jpg)
_Episode [47](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_47_(2011))_
## Battles
There is a sense of familiarity in the battles of this anime. Apart from usual scale in abilities, a constant theme is a recurring use of skills in fights.
### Killua
#### Assassin-mode × Kill
![](/011-18-043-07-051-15.png)
_Episodes [11](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_11_(2011)), [43](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_43_(2011)), [51](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_51_(2011))_
Killua rips out [Johness](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Johness)'s heart without him noticing. But Killua isn't satisfied due to the presence of blood, he mentions how his _old man_ would have done it without a drop of blood. Then we see [Chrollo](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Chrollo_Lucilfer) doing the deed against [Neon](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Neon_Nostrade), but there was a tiny amount of blood. And so, this establishes that Chrollo isn't as powerful as Killua's old man ([Zeno](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Zeno_Zoldyck)) which ultimately, is confirmed by Zeno but he wasn't sure if Chrollo was serious about the fight.

In between, we also see [Feitan](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Feitan_Portor) performing a similar act, which suggests his Assassin's Origins.
#### Ring × of × Fire
![](/050-14-068-02-129-18.jpg)
_Episodes [50](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_50_(2011)), [68](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_68_(2011)), [129](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_129_(2011))_
After being forced into fighting with guys in a ring, he develops a strategy where someone will literally burn if they enter his ring.
#### Crazy × Hands
![](/025-032-034-082.jpg)
_Episodes [25](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_25_(2011)), [32](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_32_(2011)), [34](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_34_(2011)), [82](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_82_(2011))_
Killua is familiar with fast hand movements due to [Gotoh](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Gotoh)'s coin games, which meant stopping [Riehlvelt](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Riehlvelt)'s whips was super easy. In the last picture, we see how Killua, too uses similar skills to defeat [Mosquito](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Mosquito).

As a viewer, [Machi](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Machi_Komacine)'s insane Nen stitching was another callback to enjoy.
### Gon
He gets his fair share of crazy hands too!
![](/074-082-090-099.jpg)
_Episodes [74](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_74_(2011)), [82](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_82_(2011)), [90](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_90_(2011)), [99](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_99_(2011))_
But what else,
#### Catch
![](/069-21-083-15.jpg)
_Episodes [69](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_69_(2011)), [83](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_83_(2011))_
The speed of the rolling [armadillo](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Baro) isn't even close to [Razor](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Razor)'s ultra-fast dodgeball throws. And so, Gon made light work of poor Baro.
#### Internal × Clock
![](/073-00-073-10-083-19.jpg)
_Episodes [73](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_73_(2011)), [83](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_83_(2011))_
Gon's practice to count to exactly one minute helped him in not only knowing when the gasoline card will materialise in his fight against [Genthru](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Genthru) but also helped him (and Killua) during Kite's scythe assault, which required him to jump after exactly three seconds.
#### Scream
![](/044-12-099-09.jpg)
_Episodes [44](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_44_(2011)), [99](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_99_(2011))_
Okay, this one is different because Gon didn't witness Uvogin's scream, but both are ~~stupid~~ enhancers.
## Abilities
Yes, an obvious scaling is involved but repetition of ideas increases comfort while understanding the details. 
- There is [En](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Nen#En), where we see its detection range varying from [four meters](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Nobunaga_Hazama) to a [couple of kilometres](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Neferpitou).
- [Condition strengthening](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Nen#Conditions) is also a prominent theme to increase the powers of Nen attacks, while people with extreme resolve have also utilised the life-threatening Nen contracts such as Kurapika with his Chain Jail, Kite with his Crazy Slots or Gon :( 

In this section, we will focus on some non-basic techniques and their constant usage.
### Promise × Thread
![](/030-13-037-19-104-04.jpg)
_Episodes [30](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_30_(2011)), [37](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_37_(2011)), [104](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_104_(2011))_
Master Wing introduced the concept of promise thread with strange designs which breaks using aura. Later, we see its application in breaking the box given by Ging. These designs are even found on [Knov](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Knov)'s handcuffs but usage isn't known.
### Puppets
![](/032-040-069-104-095-120.jpg)
_Episodes [32](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_32_(2011)), [40](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_40_(2011)), [69](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_69_(2011)), [95](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_95_(2011)), [104](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_104_(2011)), [120](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_120_(2011))_
One of the most fascinating abilities in the world of H×H. The technical term for them is [Nen Beasts](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Nen#Nen_Beast). We were introduced to the concept during the Hisoka vs [Kastro](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Kastro) fight. From there, we explored puppets of [Tocino](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Shachmono_Tocino) and Razor. But [Morel](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Morel_Mackernasey) was the M.V.P., he can not only create a lot of puppets but they are of _higher quality_ than any other puppets seen in the anime. Though quantity-wise, the royal guards are at a completely different level.
![](/086-14-105-13.jpg)
_Episodes [86](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_86_(2011)), [105](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_105_(2011))_
Also, an honourable mention for those puppets not intended for direct fights ft. [Bisky](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Biscuit_Krueger) and [Pitou](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Neferpitou).
### Steal
![](/052-18-106-20-135-00.jpg)
_Episodes [52](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_52_(2011)), [106](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_106_(2011)), [135](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_135_(2011))_
All the King-like personas share similar Nen abilities. Chrollo, the leader, steals abilities of others using his book; [Leol](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Leol) rents the abilities in his Pod, whereas [Meruem](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Meruem) not only learns the ability of people consumed but also improvises on it to leave us in awe.
> This, I feel is one of the major evidence for Hisoka's personality-based Nen test. Thus, we can say that the Nen type and the abilities are not something arbitrary but instead closely linked with the personalities of characters.
{: .prompt-tip}
![](/090-10-123-21.jpg)
_Episodes [90](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_90_(2011)), [123](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_123_(2011))_
On the other hand, there is [Pouf](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Shaiapouf), whose ability is to bestow Nen abilities to others. There is also [Knuckle](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Knuckle_Bine); he can give his aura for rent, and if the person fails to return it back, then they can't use Nen for a month. This is achieved using A.P.R., which is a Nen beast. So, this ability combines the above two techniques.
> An interesting aspect of H×H's abilities is that they can be combined in unimaginable ways while effortlessly merging the basics.
{: .prompt-tip}
![](/051-20-115-02.jpg)
_Episodes [51](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_51_(2011)), Episode [115](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_115_(2011))_
This Indoor Fish is an ability involving _Nen beast_ which was _stolen_ by Chrollo, while [Ikalgo](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Ikalgo) acquired [Flutter](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Flutter)'s Dragonflies, which ultimately gave way to Pouf's creative bugs.

### Behavioural × Analysis 
![](/038-07-10.jpg)
_Episode [38](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_38_(2011))_
Speaking of Pouf's abilities, remember the conversation of Gon and Killua after the tape self-erased when they stopped hearing Ging's message. Killua said, "Using data you can determine the speaker's height, weight, gender, age, facial features, chronic diseases, and **state of mind**. I wouldn't be surprised if there were a Nen user somewhere who could analyse data better than a machine. Someone who would know everything about a person just from hearing their _voice_."
![](/044-15-113-20.jpg)
_Episodes [44](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_44_(2011)), [113](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_113_(2011))_
We then met melody with extraordinary hearing capabilities who can also influence the listener by playing various songs. This gives rise to Pouf's ability 'Spiritual Message', which allows him to determine psychological state of the opponent while also creating a hypnotic effect.
<!-- speaking of Pouf's abilities, hisaAnother ability was mentioned before "You can determine the speaker's height, weight, gender, age, facial features, chronic diseases, and **state of wind**. I wouldn't be surprised if there were a Nen user somewhere who could analyse data better than a machine. Someone who would know everything about a person just from hearing their voice." Melody!! -->
### Storage

_Episodes [43](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_43_(2011)), [104](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_104_(2011))_
[Owl](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Owl) had a cloth to shrink items. [Shizuku](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Shizuku_Murasaki)'s vacuum cleaner sucks any non-living objects, though only the last item can be regurgitated. 
Meanwhile, Knov is chilling in another Nen dimension with his four-floor building with 21 rooms.
## Ideas
This part mostly deals with examples that rely of implanting ideas upon viewer that are not necessarily about the technicalities of fighting.
> An example would be to call out the one-sided nature of most major fights in H×H. Even then, it is not easy to figure out the winner, as Nen fights are not just about sheet strength. Think about it!
{: .prompt-tip}
It also includes usage of similar themes/shots throughout the show.
### Netero's × Weakness
![](/007-17-122-05.jpg)
_Episodes [7](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_7_(2011)), [122](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_122_(2011))_
In the _Showdown × On × The airship_ episode, Netero challenges Gon and Killua for a small game to snatch the ball away from him, where they will be rewarded with hunter licenses if they pass. This episode has striking similarities with Netero's fight against Meruem hundred episodes later, where the reward for Meruem is his name bestowed by this mother.

In the earlier episode, Netero avoided using his right hand and left leg, suggesting his possible preference towards them. Later, Meruem recognised this bias for his arms and exploited it by taking out his _weaker_ left hand and right leg.
### Unexpected × Teammates
![](/008-10-071-03.jpg)
_Episodes [8](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_8_(2011)), [71](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_71_(2011))_
Teaming up with the villains is so cool, I wished more anime did this.

We see the brutal display of Gon's emotions when he had to owe one to Hisoka or when he lost to Knuckle due to him being _weak_. He also had a similar stance to denote the feeling of anguish against Hisoka and Pitou. In the first case, Hisoka refused to accept take back his badge and in the second case, Pitou refused to fight Gon due to the [Komugi](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Komugi) situation.
### Disguise

[Kiriko](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Kiriko)'s disguise was in action in the second episode and also in the last episode. And guess what, Kiriko replaces Gotoh, a butler of _Zoldyck_ family who stressed the importance of safety against threats involving disguise, to Gon. And, we see that Illumi _Zoldyck_ is quite skilful in changing his appearances to Gittarackur and Hisoka.
### Self-Destruction × Prevention

While Killua was mostly self-aware to avoid fighting with stronger opponents (thanks to [Illumi](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Illumi_Zoldyck)), Gon wasn't, as we saw in his careless fights against [Gido](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Gido) and Genthru. So Killua prevented Gon's self-destruction during their first meeting with Pitou in a similar way to Gon beating him when they were trapped with [Nobunaga](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Nobunaga_Hazama).
### Gungi × Palace Invasion

Gungi can in fact, explain the entire chimera ant arc[^gungi]. But let's focus on the main theme of _Kokoriko_ which represents _Humanity_. It was the move developed by Komugi; it quickly became popular and one day was used against Komugi. So, she created a countermeasure to it and in a way killed her own development. But, later, she again used Kokoriko against Meruem stating that she has developed a _counter_ to a _counter_.

Similarly, Meruem was initially trapped by the Poor Man's Rose. But he was revived by his guards and became stronger than ever. But, the Rose contained Poison, dealing a final blow to the King and _victory_ to humans.
> Throughout the series, we see Meruem stating "do not make me repeat myself" to various characters such as [Peggy](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Peggy), [Turtle](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Turtle), **Shaiapouf**, **[Menthuthuyoupi](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Menthuthuyoupi)**, the national shogi champion and even the chairman **Netero** wasn't given the respect. And then, he actually proceeds to not repeat his words in front of them. But these were his words spoken to [Palm](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Palm_Siberia) for Komugi, "You need further explanation? It seems you doubt what you've just heard. I shall repeat myself."

## Conclusion
Hopefully, I delivered my point. There's a lot more to say about this series, from the story dynamics and the character development, to the foreshadowing and the themes of the show. But I believe there are people[^aleczandxr] who are better at this job.

Thanks to [Muse Asia](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwLSw1_eDZl2SdSro00Nvg38MQUf-5ZL8), this anime is legally available on YouTube free of cost for most Asian countries. Also, they have made the first six arcs as [standalone videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaO_HkPtJoP3uVqIIpmviNjvUpNGUMM-b) to cater binge watchers. Check out their stuff if you plan to watch the show.

_Anyway what am I saying, we've just gotten started!_[^beginning]
